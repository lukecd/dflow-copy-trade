# The DFlow API endpoint (use dev-prediction-markets-api.dflow.net for dev, prediction-markets-api.dflow.net for production)
# REQUIRED: You must set this to your desired endpoint

# Minimum Liquidity Filter
# Only consider markets with volume >= this amount (in dollars)
# Example: 1000000 = $1,000,000 minimum volume
MIN_VOLUME=1000000

# Momentum Configuration
# Time window in seconds to analyze for momentum
# Example: 60 = analyze trades from the last 60 seconds
MOMENTUM_WINDOW_SECONDS=60

# Minimum total volume (contract count) within the momentum window to trigger
# Example: 500 = at least 500 contracts traded in the window
MOMENTUM_MIN_VOLUME=750

# Minimum number of trades within the momentum window to trigger
# Example: 5 = at least 5 separate trades in the window
MOMENTUM_MIN_TRADES=6

# Minimum directional bias (0.0 to 1.0) to trigger momentum
# 1.0 = all YES trades, 0.0 = all NO trades, 0.5 = balanced
# The system checks if bias >= this OR bias <= (1 - this)
# Example: 0.7 = at least 70% of trades in one direction
MOMENTUM_MIN_DIRECTIONAL_BIAS=0.75

# Paper Trading Configuration
# Fixed dollar amount per position (contracts calculated automatically based on entry price)
# Example: 1 = $1.00 per position, 5 = $5.00 per position
POSITION_SIZE=1

# Maximum number of open positions at once
# Example: 10 = can have up to 10 positions open simultaneously
MAX_OPEN_POSITIONS=10

# Profit target as a decimal (0.05 = 5%, 0.1 = 10%)
# Set to empty/null to disable profit target
# Example: 0.025 = close position when profit reaches 2.5%
PROFIT_TARGET=0.025

# Stop loss as a decimal (0.05 = 5%, 0.1 = 10%)
# Set to empty/null to disable stop loss
# Example: 0.12 = close position when loss reaches 12%

# How often to check position prices (in milliseconds)
# Example: 2000 = check every 2 seconds

# Maximum position age in milliseconds (force close if can't get price data)
# Default: 300000 (5 minutes)

# Output Verbosity
# Set to 0 to hide, any other value to show
# Show skipped trades (markets below MIN_VOLUME threshold)

# Show momentum building messages (when momentum is building but not yet triggered)

# Cooldown Configuration
# Set to 0 to disable, any other value to enable
# Prevents re-entering positions on the same ticker after closing

# Cooldown duration in milliseconds
# Example: 60000 = 60 seconds
